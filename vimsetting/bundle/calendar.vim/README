Requires the Unix command program 'cal' or its equivalent.  Really only provides a way of pulling up a calendar into a buffer in Vim.  The script opens a buffer if one doesn't exist.  The buffer is set up to be readonly and not modified (or modifiable if 6.0 or better).  Should work for both 5.7 and 6.0x.

Usage is:  Cal 2001   | " for current year calendar
              Cal 4 2001 | " for April of 2001 month  calendar
